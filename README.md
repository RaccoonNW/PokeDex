# PokeDex

**Website URL:** https://poke-dex-wsg9.vercel.app/

This web application was developed using [React framework](https://reactjs.org/) and the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). 

When the name of a pokemon is entered into one of the search bars, a card will appear below specifying information for that specific pokemon. When both search bars are used, two cards will appear displaying the information of both pokemon, and a message will appear specifying which pokemon would win in a battle based on each of the pokemon's stats.
